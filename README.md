# Distributed-landslide-rainfall-threshold-model
This program illustrates the distributed landslide rainfall threshold model establishment based on two ways: one is sklearn module in python, and anohter is r.learn.ml2 module in Grass GIS 7.8.
(1) sklearn tutorial: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning
(2) r.learn.ml2 Manual: https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/addons/r.learn.ml2.html

distributed_threshold_model.py shows the program run in Grass GIS, and fit.py and test.py show the program run in any python editor, such as Spyder,  PyCharm and Jupyter notebook.
